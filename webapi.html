        <!-- Questions 1-10 -->
        <div class="qa">
            <h2>1. What is .NET Core?</h2>
            <p>.NET Core is a cross-platform, open-source framework developed by Microsoft. It is used for building modern, cloud-based, and internet-connected applications. It supports Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>2. What are the main differences between .NET Core and .NET Framework?</h2>
            <p>.NET Core is cross-platform and open-source, whereas .NET Framework is limited to Windows and is closed-source. .NET Core is modular and has a smaller footprint, while .NET Framework includes a larger set of libraries and components. .NET Core also provides better performance and flexibility in deployment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>3. What is ASP.NET Core?</h2>
            <p>ASP.NET Core is a framework for building modern, high-performance, and cross-platform web applications. It is a part of .NET Core and includes features for web APIs, MVC, and Razor pages.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>4. What is a Middleware in ASP.NET Core?</h2>
            <p>Middleware is a software component that is assembled into an application pipeline to handle requests and responses. Each component in the pipeline can perform operations before and after the next component in the pipeline.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>5. What is Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core?</h2>
            <p>Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. ASP.NET Core has built-in support for DI, allowing you to inject services into your classes through constructors or methods.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>6. How does routing work in ASP.NET Core?</h2>
            <p>Routing in ASP.NET Core maps incoming requests to the appropriate controller actions or endpoints. It is configured using route templates in the Startup class, and supports attribute routing and conventional routing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>7. What is Entity Framework Core?</h2>
            <p>Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is an object-relational mapper (ORM) that provides a high-level abstraction over database interactions. It allows you to work with databases using .NET objects and LINQ queries.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>8. How do you handle configuration in .NET Core?</h2>
            <p>Configuration in .NET Core is handled using the Configuration API, which supports various sources such as JSON files, environment variables, command-line arguments, and user secrets. Configuration settings are accessed via the IConfiguration interface.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>9. What is JWT?</h2>
            <p>JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It is commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>10. What is the purpose of JWT in Web API?</h2>
            <p>JWT is used in Web API to authenticate users and authorize their access to resources. It allows stateless authentication, where the token contains the user's identity and claims, eliminating the need for server-side session storage.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Questions 11-20 -->
        <div class="qa">
            <h2>11. How do you configure JWT authentication in ASP.NET Core?</h2>
            <p>JWT authentication in ASP.NET Core is configured in the Startup class using the AddAuthentication and AddJwtBearer methods. You need to specify the token validation parameters, including the issuer, audience, and signing key.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>12. What are the key components of a JWT?</h2>
            <p>A JWT consists of three parts: the header, the payload, and the signature. The header contains metadata about the token, the payload contains claims or data, and the signature ensures the integrity of the token and verifies its authenticity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>13. What is the difference between Authentication and Authorization?</h2>
            <p>Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, while Authorization determines what actions or resources the authenticated user is permitted to access. Authentication occurs before authorization in the security process.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>14. How do you generate a JWT token in ASP.NET Core?</h2>
            <p>JWT tokens are generated using the JwtSecurityToken class and the JwtSecurityTokenHandler. You create a token with the desired claims and expiration, then serialize it to a string and return it to the client.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>15. What are Claims in a JWT?</h2>
            <p>Claims are pieces of information encoded in a JWT payload that represent user attributes or roles. They can include standard claims (e.g., sub for subject) or custom claims specific to the application.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>16. How do you validate a JWT token?</h2>
            <p>JWT tokens are validated using the JwtBearer middleware, which checks the token's signature, issuer, audience, and expiration date. The token's claims are also validated based on configured validation parameters.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>17. What is ASP.NET Core Identity?</h2>
