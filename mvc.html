        <div class="qa">
            <h2>1. What is ASP.NET MVC?</h2>
            <p>ASP.NET MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a framework for building web applications using the MVC design pattern. It separates an application into three main components: the Model (data), the View (UI), and the Controller (logic), allowing for a more organized and scalable approach to web development.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>2. What are the key benefits of using ASP.NET MVC?</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Separation of concerns through the MVC design pattern</li>
                <li>Full control over HTML and JavaScript</li>
                <li>Support for test-driven development (TDD)</li>
                <li>Flexible routing</li>
                <li>Integration with modern client-side frameworks</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>3. What is the difference between ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Web Forms?</h2>
            <p>ASP.NET MVC provides a more structured and testable approach by separating concerns into Models, Views, and Controllers, whereas ASP.NET Web Forms uses a page-centric approach with tightly coupled code and UI. MVC offers more control over HTML and JavaScript, while Web Forms uses server controls and view state.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>4. Explain the MVC design pattern.</h2>
            <p>The MVC design pattern consists of:
            <ul>
                <li>Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application.</li>
                <li>View: Displays the data from the model and sends user commands to the controller.</li>
                <li>Controller: Handles user input and interactions, updates the model, and selects the view to render the response.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>5. What is the purpose of the Controller in ASP.NET MVC?</h2>
            <p>The Controller in ASP.NET MVC handles incoming requests, processes them, and returns responses. It interacts with the Model to retrieve or update data and selects the appropriate View to render the response to the client.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>6. What is a View in ASP.NET MVC?</h2>
            <p>A View in ASP.NET MVC is responsible for rendering the user interface (UI) by displaying data from the Model. It consists of HTML markup and can include embedded C# code to dynamically generate content based on the data provided by the Controller.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>7. What is a Model in ASP.NET MVC?</h2>
            <p>A Model in ASP.NET MVC represents the data and business logic of the application. It is responsible for retrieving, manipulating, and storing data. Models can include classes, properties, and methods that define the application's data structure and behavior.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>8. What is Routing in ASP.NET MVC?</h2>
            <p>Routing in ASP.NET MVC is the process of mapping URLs to controller actions. It allows you to define URL patterns and route requests to the appropriate controller and action method. Routing is configured in the RouteConfig class or attribute-based routing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>9. How does the ASP.NET MVC routing system work?</h2>
            <p>The ASP.NET MVC routing system works by matching incoming URL requests to defined route patterns. When a request is received, the routing engine checks the URL against the registered routes and determines which controller and action method should handle the request.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>10. What are route constraints in ASP.NET MVC?</h2>
            <p>Route constraints are conditions that must be met for a route to be matched. They are used to restrict the types of values that can be passed in a route parameter. Constraints can be applied to routes to enforce rules such as integer values, specific formats, or custom logic.</p>
        </div>
