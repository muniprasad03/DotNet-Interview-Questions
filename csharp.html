        <div class="qa">
            <h2>1. What is C#?</h2>
            <p>C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft as part of the .NET framework. It is used for developing a wide range of applications from web services to desktop applications.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>2. What is the difference between a class and an object in C#?</h2>
            <p>A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the data and behavior that the objects created from the class will have. An object is an instance of a class, created based on the class definition.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>3. Explain the concept of inheritance in C#.</h2>
            <p>Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming where a new class (derived class) is based on an existing class (base class). The derived class inherits the fields and methods from the base class and can also have additional fields and methods of its own.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>4. What is the difference between "ref" and "out" parameters in C#?</h2>
            <p>The "ref" keyword is used to pass a parameter by reference, allowing the method to modify the value of the parameter. The "out" keyword is similar but is used to indicate that the parameter will be assigned a value within the method, and it must be assigned before the method exits.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>5. What is the purpose of the "using" statement in C#?</h2>
            <p>The "using" statement is used to ensure that resources are properly disposed of after they are no longer needed. It is typically used with objects that implement the IDisposable interface, such as file streams or database connections.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>6. What are delegates in C#?</h2>
            <p>Delegates are objects that represent references to methods. They are used to pass methods as arguments to other methods and to define callback methods. Delegates are type-safe and secure function pointers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>7. What is a lambda expression in C#?</h2>
            <p>A lambda expression is a concise way to represent an anonymous method. It is used primarily in LINQ queries and allows for the creation of inline delegate instances. Lambda expressions use the syntax `()=>{}` and can capture variables from their enclosing context.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>8. What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class in C#?</h2>
            <p>An interface defines a contract that classes must implement, but it does not provide any implementation details. An abstract class, on the other hand, can provide some method implementations and can contain fields. Abstract classes are used when classes share common functionality, while interfaces are used to define a contract that multiple classes can implement.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>9. What are generics in C#?</h2>
            <p>Generics allow you to define classes, interfaces, and methods with a placeholder for the type they operate on. This enables you to create type-safe data structures and methods without sacrificing performance or type safety. Generics are used to create collections and other types that work with any data type.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>10. What is the difference between "async" and "await" in C#?</h2>
            <p>The "async" keyword is used to define a method as asynchronous, allowing it to perform tasks without blocking the main thread. The "await" keyword is used within an "async" method to pause the execution until a task is completed, enabling asynchronous operations to be written in a synchronous-like manner.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>11. What is a "Task" in C# and how does it differ from a "Thread"?</h2>
            <p>A "Task" represents an asynchronous operation that can be awaited and is part of the Task Parallel Library (TPL). It provides a higher-level abstraction for managing asynchronous operations compared to raw threads. A "Thread" represents a lower-level unit of execution and requires more manual management compared to Tasks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>12. How does dependency injection work in C#?</h2>
            <p>Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) by injecting dependencies into a class rather than the class creating its own dependencies. In C#, DI is commonly used with frameworks like ASP.NET Core to manage service lifetimes and facilitate testing and maintainability.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>13. What is the difference between "IEnumerable" and "IQueryable"?</h2>
            <p"IEnumerable" is an interface that allows for iterating over a collection in a forward-only manner. It is typically used for in-memory collections. "IQueryable" extends "IEnumerable" and allows for querying against a data source, such as a database, using LINQ. It enables deferred execution and more efficient querying for data sources.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>14. What are extension methods in C#?</h2>
            <p>Extension methods allow you to add new methods to existing types without modifying the original type. They are defined as static methods in a static class but are called as if they were instance methods on the extended type. This is useful for adding functionality to classes for which you do not have access to the source code.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>15. What is a "readonly" field in C#?</h2>
            <p>A "readonly" field is a field that can only be assigned a value at the time of declaration or within the constructor of the class. Once assigned, its value cannot be changed. This is used to create immutable objects or constants that need to be set at runtime.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>16. What is a "property" in C#?</h2>
            <p>A property in C# is a member of a class that provides a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the value of a private field. Properties are accessed using the get and set accessors and offer a way to encapsulate data and provide controlled access to it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>17. Explain the concept of "boxing" and "unboxing" in C#.</h2>
            <p"Boxing" is the process of converting a value type (such as int or float) to an object type. "Unboxing" is the reverse process, where an object type is converted back to a value type. Boxing and unboxing involve performance overhead and should be used cautiously.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>18. What is the purpose of the "dynamic" type in C#?</h2>
            <p>The "dynamic" type in C# allows for operations on objects where the type is not known at compile time. It defers type checking until runtime, which can be useful for interacting with dynamic languages or performing operations on objects with unknown types. However, it comes with performance costs and potential runtime errors.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>19. What is a "static" class in C#?</h2>
            <p>A "static" class in C# is a class that cannot be instantiated and can only contain static members. It is used to group related methods and properties that do not require an instance of the class to operate. Static classes are often used for utility or helper methods.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>20. How does exception handling work in C#?</h2>
            <p>Exception handling in C# is achieved using try-catch-finally blocks. The "try" block contains code that may throw exceptions, the "catch" block handles exceptions that occur, and the "finally" block contains code that is executed regardless of whether an exception was thrown. This mechanism helps to manage and respond to runtime errors gracefully.</p>
        </div>

         <div class="qa">
            <h2>21. What is a "constructor" in C#?</h2>
            <p>A constructor is a special method in a class that is called when an object is instantiated. It is used to initialize the object's data and can be overloaded to provide multiple ways of initializing the object.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>22. What is method overloading in C#?</h2>
            <p>Method overloading allows multiple methods to have the same name but different parameters within the same class. It is used to increase the readability of the program by allowing different ways to perform a similar operation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>23. What is method overriding in C#?</h2>
            <p>Method overriding occurs when a derived class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its base class. It is used to achieve polymorphism in object-oriented programming.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>24. Explain the "sealed" keyword in C#.</h2>
            <p>The "sealed" keyword is used to prevent a class from being inherited. It can also be applied to methods to prevent them from being overridden in derived classes. Sealing a class or method improves performance and maintains design constraints.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>25. What are "value types" and "reference types" in C#?</h2>
            <p>Value types hold data directly and are typically stored on the stack (e.g., int, float, struct). Reference types hold a reference to the data, which is stored on the heap (e.g., class, string, array). Value types are usually faster but less flexible, while reference types offer more flexibility but can involve more overhead.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>26. What is a "static constructor" in C#?</h2>
            <p>A static constructor is a constructor that is used to initialize the type itself rather than instances of the type. It is called automatically before any static members of the type are accessed or any static methods are invoked.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>27. What is the difference between "override" and "new" keywords in method hiding?</h2>
            <p>The "override" keyword is used to extend or modify the abstract or virtual implementation of an inherited method. The "new" keyword is used to hide an inherited method and provide a new implementation in the derived class. "Override" maintains polymorphic behavior, while "new" does not.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>28. What is "enum" in C# and how is it used?</h2>
            <p>An "enum" (short for enumeration) is a distinct value type that consists of a set of named constants called enumerators. Enums are used to represent a collection of related values in a readable and maintainable way.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>29. Explain "garbage collection" in C#.</h2>
            <p>Garbage collection is an automatic memory management feature in .NET that reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use, preventing memory leaks and optimizing memory usage. The garbage collector runs periodically and cleans up objects that are no longer referenced by the application.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>30. What is the purpose of "LINQ" in C#?</h2>
            <p>LINQ (Language Integrated Query) provides a unified query syntax to work with different types of data sources, including arrays, collections, databases, and XML. It allows for querying data in a more readable and expressive way using a consistent syntax integrated into the C# language.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>31. What is the "volatile" keyword in C#?</h2>
            <p>The "volatile" keyword is used to indicate that a field's value may be changed by different threads simultaneously. It ensures that the most up-to-date value of the field is always read from memory, rather than using a cached value, which is crucial for thread safety.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>32. How do "events" and "delegates" work together in C#?</h2>
            <p>Events and delegates work together to provide a mechanism for event-driven programming. A delegate is a type-safe function pointer, while an event is a special kind of delegate that allows methods to be added or removed from its invocation list. Events provide a way for objects to notify other objects when something of interest occurs.</p>

            <h2>33. What are "attributes" in C#?</h2>
            <p>Attributes in C# are metadata that can be added to assemblies, classes, methods, properties, and other program elements to provide additional information. They are used to modify or retrieve information at runtime through reflection and can influence program behavior or provide documentation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>34. What is the "async/await" pattern used for in C#?</h2>
            <p>The "async/await" pattern is used to write asynchronous code in a more readable and maintainable way. The "async" keyword is applied to methods to indicate that they contain asynchronous operations, while "await" is used within these methods to pause execution until the awaited operation completes, improving responsiveness and scalability.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>35. What is "deferred execution" in LINQ?</h2>
            <p>Deferred execution means that the execution of a LINQ query is postponed until the query is actually enumerated or iterated over. This allows for queries to be built up dynamically and can result in more efficient execution by combining multiple queries into a single query executed against the data source.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Previous Questions from 1-35 -->
        
        <div class="qa">
            <h2>36. What is a "partial class" in C#?</h2>
            <p>A partial class allows a class to be split into multiple files. Each file contains a part of the class's implementation. This is useful for managing large classes and separating auto-generated code from user-defined code.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>37. What is a "constructor chaining" in C#?</h2>
            <p>Constructor chaining is the practice of calling one constructor from another within the same class using the "this" keyword. This is useful for reusing constructor code and ensuring consistent initialization.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>38. Explain "property" initialization in C#.</h2>
            <p>Property initialization allows you to initialize properties directly at the point of declaration. This feature, introduced in C# 6.0, simplifies object initialization and enhances code readability.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>39. What is a "destructor" in C#?</h2>
            <p>A destructor is a special method that is called when an object is being destroyed. It is used to release unmanaged resources held by the object. In C#, destructors are defined with a tilde (~) before the class name and are automatically called by the garbage collector.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>40. What is the "dynamic" type in C#?</h2>
            <p>The "dynamic" type allows for dynamic type checking at runtime instead of compile-time. It can be used to work with objects where the type is not known until runtime, but it bypasses compile-time type checking, which may lead to runtime errors.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>41. What are "anonymous types" in C#?</h2>
            <p>Anonymous types are types that are defined without a name. They are typically used for storing data in a lightweight way, especially when querying data with LINQ. The compiler generates the class and properties based on the provided initialization.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>42. What is the purpose of the "default" keyword in C#?</h2>
            <p>The "default" keyword is used to obtain the default value of a type. For value types, it returns the zero-initialized value (e.g., 0 for integers, false for bool). For reference types, it returns null.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>43. Explain the "using" directive and "using" statement in C#.</h2>
            <p>The "using" directive is used to include namespaces in a C# file, making it easier to reference classes from those namespaces. The "using" statement is used to ensure that objects implementing IDisposable are properly disposed of when they are no longer needed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>44. What is "expression-bodied syntax" in C#?</h2>
            <p>Expression-bodied syntax is a shorthand notation for defining methods, properties, and other members that consist of a single expression. It uses the "=>" syntax and simplifies the code by reducing boilerplate.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>45. What are "null-coalescing operators" in C#?</h2>
            <p>Null-coalescing operators are used to provide a default value when dealing with null values. The "??" operator returns the value on its left if it is not null; otherwise, it returns the value on its right. The "??=" operator assigns the right-hand value to the left-hand variable only if the left-hand variable is null.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>46. What is the "params" keyword in C#?</h2>
            <p>The "params" keyword allows a method to accept a variable number of arguments. It is used to create methods that can take an arbitrary number of arguments of a specified type, which are treated as an array within the method.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>47. What is the "yield" keyword in C#?</h2>
            <p>The "yield" keyword is used in iterator methods to provide a value to the enumerator object or to signal the end of iteration. It simplifies the creation of custom iterators and allows for lazy evaluation of sequences.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>48. What are "local functions" in C#?</h2>
            <p>Local functions are functions defined inside another method. They are used to encapsulate logic that is only relevant within the containing method, improving readability and maintainability by reducing the scope of the function.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>49. What is the difference between "async" and "await" keywords?</h2>
            <p>The "async" keyword is used to mark a method as asynchronous, allowing it to use the "await" keyword inside its body. The "await" keyword is used to asynchronously wait for the completion of a task, enabling non-blocking operations and improving responsiveness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>50. What is a "value tuple" in C#?</h2>
            <p>A value tuple is a data structure that provides a lightweight way to store a set of values with different types. Unlike traditional tuples, value tuples can be created with named fields and are more performant due to their value type nature.</p>

            <h2>51. What are "extension methods" in C#?</h2>
            <p>Extension methods allow you to add new methods to existing types without modifying the original type. They are defined as static methods in a static class and are called as if they were instance methods on the extended type.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>52. What is the "is" keyword used for in C#?</h2>
            <p>The "is" keyword is used to check if an object is compatible with a given type or if it can be cast to that type. It is commonly used for type checking in conditional statements.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>53. What is the "as" keyword in C#?</h2>
            <p>The "as" keyword is used for safe type casting. It attempts to cast an object to a specified type and returns null if the cast fails, avoiding exceptions that would be thrown by a direct cast.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>186. What is "explicit interface implementation" in C#?</h2>
            <p>Explicit interface implementation allows a class to provide a specific implementation for an interface member, which can only be accessed through the interface reference. This technique helps in resolving member name conflicts and ensures that the interface implementation is only accessible through the interface.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>187. What is the "volatile" keyword in C#?</h2>
            <p>The "volatile" keyword indicates that a field can be accessed by multiple threads concurrently, and it tells the compiler and runtime not to optimize or cache the field. It ensures that the most recent value is always read from memory, avoiding issues with data visibility across threads.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>188. What is "ref" and "out" keyword in C#?</h2>
            <p>The "ref" keyword is used to pass arguments by reference, allowing the method to modify the value of the argument. The "out" keyword is similar but requires that the method initializes the argument before returning. Both keywords allow methods to return multiple values.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>189. What is "stack" and "heap" in C#?</h2>
            <p>The stack is a region of memory used for static memory allocation, where value types and method call information are stored. The heap is used for dynamic memory allocation, where reference types and objects are stored. Stack memory is managed automatically, while heap memory requires garbage collection.</p>

            <h2>190. What is "attribute routing" in ASP.NET?</h2>
            <p>Attribute routing allows you to define routes directly on controller actions using attributes, providing more control over routing compared to conventional routing. It enables you to specify route templates and constraints directly in the action methods or controllers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>191. What is "conventional routing" in ASP.NET?</h2>
            <p>Conventional routing defines routes based on a predefined pattern or convention, such as URL patterns and route templates. Routes are typically configured in the startup class or route configuration file, providing a centralized way to manage routing logic.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>192. What is "Model Binding" in ASP.NET?</h2>
            <p>Model binding is the process of mapping HTTP request data to action method parameters or model properties in ASP.NET. It simplifies data extraction and validation by automatically converting request data into strongly-typed objects based on the method's parameters or model properties.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>193. What is "ActionResult" in ASP.NET MVC?</h2>
            <p>ActionResult is a base class for all result types returned by controller actions in ASP.NET MVC. It represents the result of an action method and can be used to return different types of responses, such as views, JSON data, or file downloads.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>194. What is "ViewBag" in ASP.NET MVC?</h2>
            <p>ViewBag is a dynamic property that allows you to pass data from a controller to a view. It provides a way to transfer data between components without using strongly-typed models, and the data is accessible only for the current request.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>195. What is "ViewData" in ASP.NET MVC?</h2>
            <p>ViewData is a dictionary object used to pass data from a controller to a view. Unlike ViewBag, which uses dynamic properties, ViewData uses key-value pairs to store and retrieve data. It requires explicit type casting for complex types.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>196. What is "TempData" in ASP.NET MVC?</h2>
            <p>TempData is a dictionary object used to pass data between actions during the current request and the subsequent request. It is useful for transferring data that is needed only temporarily, such as for redirect scenarios, and the data is automatically removed after being read.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>197. What is "Entity Framework"?</h2>
            <p>Entity Framework (EF) is an object-relational mapper (ORM) that provides a higher-level abstraction for interacting with a database. It allows you to work with data using .NET objects and provides features such as change tracking, lazy loading, and query capabilities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>198. What is "Code First" approach in Entity Framework?</h2>
            <p>The Code First approach in Entity Framework allows you to define your database schema using C# code by creating classes and configuring mappings. EF will then generate the database schema based on these classes, providing more control over the database structure and design.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>199. What is "Database First" approach in Entity Framework?</h2>
            <p>The Database First approach in Entity Framework involves generating entity classes and a DbContext based on an existing database schema. It is useful when working with an existing database where you want to create a model based on the current database structure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>200. What is "Model First" approach in Entity Framework?</h2>
            <p>The Model First approach in Entity Framework involves designing your data model using an Entity Framework Designer, and then generating the database schema from the model. This approach is useful for designing the database schema visually before generating the corresponding code.</p>
