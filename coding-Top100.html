            <div class="question-header">1. What is the difference between `ref` and `out` parameters in C#?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
                <p>The `ref` and `out` keywords are used to pass arguments by reference. However, there are some differences:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initialization:</strong> Variables passed as `ref` must be initialized before being passed to the method, while variables passed as `out` do not need to be initialized.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assignment:</strong> `ref` parameters need to be assigned a value before they are passed, while `out` parameters must be assigned a value within the method.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card">
            <div class="question-header">2. What is the difference between `IEnumerable` and `ICollection`?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>IEnumerable:</strong> Represents a forward-only cursor to iterate through a collection of items.</p>
                <p><strong>ICollection:</strong> Represents a collection of objects that can be individually accessed by index. It also provides additional methods for adding, removing, and checking for items.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card">
            <div class="question-header">3. How does garbage collection work in C#?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
                <p>C# uses an automatic garbage collection mechanism to manage memory. The garbage collector (GC) automatically releases memory that is no longer in use, helping to prevent memory leaks. It works by periodically identifying and freeing objects that are no longer referenced by the application.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card">
            <div class="question-header">4. What is the difference between `abstract` class and `interface` in C#?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
                <p>An `abstract` class can provide some implementation, whereas an `interface` cannot provide implementation. A class can inherit from only one `abstract` class but can implement multiple interfaces.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card">
            <div class="question-header">5. What is the purpose of the `using` statement in C#?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
                <p>The `using` statement is used to ensure that an object is disposed of properly once it is no longer needed, which is particularly useful for managing resources like file handles and database connections.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card">
            <div class="question-header">6. What is the difference between `String` and `StringBuilder` in C#?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
                <p>`String` is immutable, meaning that once a `String` object is created, it cannot be changed. `StringBuilder` is mutable and provides a more efficient way to modify strings when performing a lot of operations.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card">
            <div class="question-header">7. What are `delegates` in C#?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
                <p>Delegates are type-safe function pointers that allow methods to be passed as parameters. They can be used to define callback methods and event handlers.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card">
            <div class="question-header">8. How does exception handling work in C#?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
                <p>Exception handling in C# is done using `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks. The `try` block contains the code that might throw an exception, the `catch` block handles the exception, and the `finally` block is used for cleanup code that runs regardless of whether an exception was thrown.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card">
            <div class="question-header">9. What is LINQ in C#?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
                <p>LINQ (Language Integrated Query) provides a consistent query experience across various types of data sources. It allows querying collections, databases, XML, and other data sources using a unified syntax.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card">
            <div class="question-header">10. What is the difference between `==` and `Equals` method in C#?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
                <p>`==` is used to compare the reference equality of objects, while the `Equals` method is used to compare the content or value of objects. The behavior of `Equals` can be overridden in classes to provide custom equality checks.</p>

        <div class="question-card">
            <div class="question-header">12. What is the purpose

 of `async` and `await` in C#?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
                <p>The `async` and `await` keywords are used to simplify asynchronous programming in C#. They allow for the writing of asynchronous code that is easier to read and maintain, enabling non-blocking operations and improving performance.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card">
            <div class="question-header">13. What are `attributes` in C#?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
                <p>Attributes are metadata added to code elements (such as classes, methods, or properties) to provide additional information about the element. They can be used to influence behavior, provide information for reflection, or modify code generation.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card">
            <div class="question-header">14. What is `dependency injection`?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
                <p>Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. It allows for the decoupling of classes by injecting dependencies from outside rather than creating them internally.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card">
            <div class="question-header">15. Explain the `foreach` loop in C#.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
                <p>The `foreach` loop is used to iterate over a collection or array in a read-only manner. It provides a simple way to access each element without needing an explicit index.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card">
            <div class="question-header">16. What is the `dynamic` type in C#?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
                <p>The `dynamic` type bypasses compile-time type checking and defers type checking to runtime. It is useful when working with objects whose types are not known until runtime.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card">
            <div class="question-header">17. What is a `static` class in C#?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
                <p>A `static` class is a class that cannot be instantiated and can only contain static members. It is used for grouping methods that do not need to maintain any state.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card">
            <div class="question-header">18. What is the difference between `Task` and `Thread`?</div>
